Arthur's Emacs configuration and libraries

I mostly use emacs for programming in C++.

Highlights:
* top level configuration (.emacs) in init.el
* in-emacs comic book and image viewer (.cbz, .zip, .rar, .pdf, web pages...). in eye.el
* jump to definition and multiple-language eldoc mode, powered by etags/ebrowse/imenu, in the style of hippie-expand, in hippie-help.el
* highlight hexadecimal constants in their ARGB color in hexcolor.el
* color themes in arthur-theme.el
* toys (both originally written by other people): u-mandelbrot.el, analog-clock.el
